# REST API

- Rest stands for REpresentaional State Transfer 
- API stands for Application Programming Interface

- It is a software that allows two applications to communicate with each other over the internet and through various devices. Every time you access an app like Facebook or check the weather on your smartphone, an API is used.

- A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface(API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data.  REST is not a programming language.
